	Positive:
		1. Path from top abstraction to concrete entity is visible.
	Negative:
		1. The same node could exists in different places of the tree - very uncomfortably.
		2. Load/Save are annoying: shoud work with web resource, use Refresh insted of [Save, Load, Find last selected node].
		2. Drag spacetree needed.
		3. Full expand for spacetree needed.
